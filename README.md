# Learning Vue

I recently joined a team creating a website for Code Future. They're using Vue, so I'm taking this opportunity to learn how to use the framework too!

This repo contains my records as I learn how to use Vue, primarily through The Net Ninja's tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1). So all of my notes from the lessons will be in 'notes', all of my practice projecs will just be in this main directory.
